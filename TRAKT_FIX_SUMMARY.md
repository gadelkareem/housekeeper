# Trakt Daily Authentication Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
Trakt was requesting a new authentication token every day, causing the application to prompt for manual re-authentication daily. This was happening because:

1. **Trakt API Change**: In March 2025, Trakt reduced OAuth access token expiration from 3 months to 24 hours for enhanced security.
2. **Faulty Token Expiry Detection**: The code expected a `created_at` field that wasn't provided by the Trakt API.
3. **Poor Token Refresh Handling**: The automatic token refresh mechanism wasn't working properly.

## Root Cause Analysis
- The `is_token_expired()` method was checking for a `created_at` timestamp that didn't exist in the token response
- When token expiry couldn't be determined, the code defaulted to full re-authentication instead of using refresh tokens
- The trakt.py library's built-in refresh mechanism wasn't being utilized properly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Token Expiry Detection (`is_token_expired` method)
- **Before**: Expected `created_at` field from API response (which doesn't exist)
- **After**: Adds `created_at` timestamp when missing and saves it to the auth file
- **Result**: Proper token expiry tracking

### 2. Improved Token Refresh Mechanism (`ensure_valid_token` method)
- **Before**: Immediately deleted auth file and forced full re-authentication
- **After**: 
  - Uses trakt.py's built-in refresh mechanism first
  - Makes a test API call to trigger automatic refresh
  - Only falls back to full re-authentication if refresh fails
- **Result**: Seamless token renewal without user intervention

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Before**: Generic error handling that didn't distinguish between token issues and other API errors
- **After**: 
  - Specific OAuth error handling
  - Automatic retry with fresh token on auth failures
  - Better logging for debugging
- **Result**: More robust API interactions

### 4. Fixed Token Persistence
- **Before**: Tokens saved without proper expiry metadata
- **After**: 
  - `on_authenticated()` adds `created_at` timestamp to new tokens
  - `on_token_refreshed()` adds `created_at` timestamp to refreshed tokens
  - `auth_save()` method for consistent token saving
- **Result**: Proper token lifecycle management

### 5. Fixed Auth File Path Issue
- **Before**: Used `sys.path[0]` which varies depending on how script is executed
- **After**: Uses `config.root_path` for consistent file location (same as config.yaml)
- **Result**: Auth file always stored in project root, regardless of execution context

## Code Changes Summary

### New/Modified Methods:
- `__init__()` - Added `self.auth_file_path` using `config.root_path`
- `auth_load()` - Updated to use `self.auth_file_path`
- `auth_save()` - New method for saving authorization data using `self.auth_file_path`
- `is_token_expired()` - Fixed to handle missing `created_at` field
- `ensure_valid_token()` - Improved to use refresh mechanism before re-authentication
- `on_authenticated()` - Now adds `created_at` timestamp and uses `self.auth_file_path`
- `on_token_refreshed()` - Now adds `created_at` timestamp and uses `self.auth_file_path`
- `watched_movies()` - Added better OAuth error handling
- `watched_series()` - Added better OAuth error handling

### Key Improvements:
1. **Automatic Token Refresh**: Uses trakt.py's built-in refresh capability
2. **Proper Expiry Tracking**: Adds and maintains `created_at` timestamps
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to full auth only when refresh fails
4. **Better Logging**: More detailed debug information for troubleshooting

## Testing
A test script (`test_trakt_auth.py`) has been created to verify:
- Token expiry detection
- Automatic refresh functionality  
- API call success after token refresh
- Error handling

## Expected Result
- **Before**: Daily authentication prompts
- **After**: Automatic token refresh every 24 hours without user intervention

## Usage
The fixes are automatic - no configuration changes needed. The application will:
1. Check token expiry with 1-hour buffer
2. Automatically refresh tokens using refresh_token
3. Only prompt for re-authentication if refresh fails (rare)

Run `python test_trakt_auth.py` to verify the fixes are working correctly.
